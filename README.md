# EventPost:

The goal is to achieve a fully deployed system while using and learning continuous and incremental integration, cloud services and agile procedures in projects. 
Further information about the project and previous milestones is available in the __[documentation](https://carlos-el.github.io/EventPost-CCProject/index).__

### User stories:
The user stories that came up are the following.
- As user I want to create an account so I can keep track of the events I like.
- As user I want to be able to look for events related to my likes, events near me so I do not have to make a trip and events that are going to take place next week so I can make a schedule.
- As an administrator I want to be able to manage events information so in case an event date change a can edit it.
- As user I would like to set reminder notifications of events I like and schedule a certain date and time for them so in case I have to buy tickets I can do it on time.
- As user I would like to be able to change the mail where the remainder notification is going to be send.  
- As user I want to receive notification on time so I do not mess up my schedule and add delay notifications in case I change my mind.  

##### System functionality:
The features found out in the user stories for each microservice have been mapped into milestones and its corresponding issues (links to milestones below). 
- [Events](https://github.com/carlos-el/EventPost-CCProject/milestone/6):
    -   Get events related to a topic.
    -   Get events happening in a range of time.
    -   Get events happening in a specified location.
    -   Get information of a certain event.
    -   Create an event.
    -   Delete an event.
    -   Edit an event.
- [Notifications](https://github.com/carlos-el/EventPost-CCProject/milestone/7):
    -   Create a notification.
    -   Get the notifications related to an account.
    -   Update the scheduled date and time of a notification.
    -   Update the email where a notification is going to be send.
    -   Delete a notification. 
- [Email-sender](https://github.com/carlos-el/EventPost-CCProject/milestone/8): 
    -   Send email notifications.

Additionally the User management system will include the following features.
[Users Management](https://github.com/carlos-el/EventPost-CCProject/milestone/5):
    -   Create an account.
    -   Delete an account.
    -   Update email.
    -   Add a secondary email to an account.

This features has been mapped into milestones and issues

### Database management:
In our system we will store the following data:
- Users data for authentication and user management (passwords, usernames, emails.)
- Events data (title, descriptions, date, time, place, topic).
- Notifications data (destination email, subject, content, scheduled time, event associated.)

In order to keep services independent, a Database-per-service architecture will be implemented. Each database will be private to its corresponding microservice. As there are no relation in our databases a NoSQL database will be used.

### Technologies:
- The __microservices__ will consist in the following:
    - Email-sender microservice will be implemented using NodeJS. This microservice is only intended for performing the task of sending emails and only communicates with the other system components through message broker. Therefore the only npm libreries needed for it are [amqplib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib) and [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) which are widely known and easy to use.
    - The Users Management service and Events and Notification microservices will be implemented in Python. [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/) will be used as framework for working with HTTP RESTful requests and responses. It has been chosen for being a light-weight microframework written in Python that supports the REST architectural style. It is not suitable for serving HTML but this will not be a problem in our case. Our microservices have to send tasks over the AMQP protocol to a message broker, for this reason they will also use the library [pika](https://pypi.org/project/pika/) as it is designed for RabbitMQ brokers like the one that we are going to deploy.

- The __API Gateway__ will be deployed used [Express Gateway](https://www.express-gateway.io/) which uses NodeJS. It is one of the few API Gateways for NodeJS, it is simple, for general purpose and allows the fast development lifecycle required in agile projects.

- Our centralized system for __configuration and service discovery__ across microservices will be established using [Consul](https://www.consul.io/discovery.html) because it is designed especially for this task, it is easy to deploy and configure and it comes almost ready to work. It also supports containers.  

- For our __logging system__ we will be using [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/), a SaaS platform that will provide an already deployed realiable enviroment for our logs. It offers free plans (lite) which grants enough features for our project. Moreover it can work as a monitoring system by searching log data for events and setting alerts. 

- For the __message broker__ we will use [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com/). It is a platform that offers RabbitMQ instances as a service and it also has free plans that cover our needs for this project. This will save us work when developing the deployment chain.

- As the __storage__ needed for our microservices consist on NoSQL databases, some of them with a consisten amount of data, we are going to use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es). MongoDB is a document database which pairs quite well with the information needed to store events where we need a single object and joins will not going to be used. The [pymongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) library will be used in our python microservices so they can connect with the database.

- Finally, __continuous integration__ and test will be done using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) as it provides easy sync with GitHub and supports all the languages present in our project and Docker. Circle-CI was considered but its free plan lacks some features that Travis provides for open source projects. The test will be also used in local with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
