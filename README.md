# EventPost:

### The idea for this project is to develop a microservices based application for events management and discovering.

An user could __browse__ through different kind of events, select one and program email-based __notifications__ for. __Subscriptions__ to different event feeds could also be possible. 

As first approach, __microservices for managing users, events, notifications and sending the emails__ are needed, as well as an __API Gateway__.

Further information will be specified as the course goes on.
