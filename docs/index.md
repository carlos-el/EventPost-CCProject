# Project documentation section.
### Abstract:
We will develop an applicaction for managing, discovering and browsing events.
* The user adressing the page willl be able to:
    - Create an account in our service.
    - Browse he page in order to find event of interest.
    - Program email-based notifications for different events. 
    - Manage email-based subscriptions to different feeds based on event topics.
    

* We will be using a microservices based arquitecture. The microservices needed and their specifications to achieve our goal are the following:
    - One for managing user accounts. Stores the users information and receives request for authentication and managing account. A RESTful API will be used for communication. Language and technology still to decide.
    - Another for managing events. Stores events information and receives request for managing events. A RESTful API will be used for communication. Language and technology still to decide.
    - A microservice for managin the notifications. Stores information relevant for the notifications and receives requests for managing them. Also uses a RESTful API for communication. Language and technology still to decide.
    - Other microservice for sending the emails requested by other services. Includes a queue of emails and send them in order. Therefore the communication protocol will be AMQP. We will develop it in Javascript using node.js and RabbitMQ as messaging middleware.
    - Finally and API Gateway is also needed as an interface for interacting with the microservices and authenticating users in different services. In order to create a good experience for the user React will be used for creating the frontend of the API Gateway

 More information will be given as the course goes on.
